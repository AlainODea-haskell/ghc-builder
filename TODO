* Don't put the build directory so deep (builder/tempbuild/build)
* Mailing list for commits
* Add a deafening client verbosity which also prints command output
* Add SSL instructions to docs
* Check SSL is actually being used correctly
* Some sort of client-side locking and server-side check so the same
  client can't run/connect twice
* More exception handling (e.g. catch the exception when we fail to
  clean tempbuild, and put it somewhere visible)
* "validate this bundle please" feature
* Add a "start build now" button to the web interface
* e-mail report collation
* IRC reporting
* twitter
* RSS
* Look at using timezone-series or timezone-olson to better handle timezones
* Don't send password; send hash(salt;password) instead
* Add build "flunk"ing. Use for testsuite.
* Add a way for "results" (e.g. bindists) to be uploaded?
