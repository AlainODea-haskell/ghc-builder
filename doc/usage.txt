SSL keys and certificates
=========================

All SSL keys/certificates generated expire after 30 years. They are
only protected with a password of "password", so you will need to use
file permissions to keep them secret.

In certs/ run "mkRoot.sh". This will create
    ca_key.pem  Used to make the SSL keys for the client and server
    root.pem    Used by clients to check that the server cert is valid

In certs/ run "mkServerKey.sh hostname" where hostname is the name that
your clients will connect to (e.g. "darcs.haskell.org"). This will
create
    server.pem  The server's key

In certs/ run "mkClientKey.sh clientusername". This will create
    client.pem  The key for that client

Server
======

The server is initialised with
    ./server init

Clients are added to the Config.hs file, in the "clients"
value. You then need to run
    ./server add username

The server is run with
    ./server
or
    ./server -v

Clients can currently be
    Continuous              (as soon as one build finishes, the next begins)
    Timed (mkTime 13 55)    (builds start at 1:55pm)

Client
======

Clients are initialised with:
    ./client init username password hostname

Clients are run with:
    ./client
or
    ./client -v
